Git Tutorial 17 

Branching

* We can use the concept of branch to have multiple copies of same file all working differently

* For example we have test file in a folder. The default branch is master. We can make a differnet branch named sample.
* Now switch to new branch and make all the changes in that branch. It will have no effect on master branch. 
* We can switch to any branch at any time
* After finishing if we want we can merge the 2 branches to merge the changes between 2 files
* If confict come, it will show both code we can modify the code manually and then merge it back

* git branch 
to show all the branches available

* git branch sample
to create a new branch sample

* git checkout sample
to switch to sample

* git merge sample
to merge sample to master

GIT Tutorial 6

Git Workflow and Adding Single file

* While working with a file we have 3 stages 

1. Working copy
2. Staging area
3. Repository 

* When we create a file it is a working copy
* When we add it using git add . then it is in staging area
* When we commit it, it is in the repository stage

* Single file can be added to the repository by 

* git add "Sample file 2.txt"

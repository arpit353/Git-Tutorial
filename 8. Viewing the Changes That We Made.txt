Git Tutorial 8

Viewing the Changes That We Made

* We can use git diff to see changes between the modified files before commiting and files in the repository

* git status

On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   Sample file.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

* git diff

diff --git a/Sample file.txt b/Sample file.txt
index b989c53..a86480f 100644
--- a/Sample file.txt
+++ b/Sample file.txt
